 * A RayCast represents a line from its origin to its destination position, `cast_to`. It is used to query the 3D space in order to find the closest object along the path of the ray.
 *
 * RayCast can ignore some objects by adding them to the exception list via `add_exception` or by setting proper filtering with collision layers and masks.
 *
 * RayCast can be configured to report collisions with [Area]s ([member collide_with_areas]) and/or [PhysicsBody]s ([member collide_with_bodies]).
 *
 * Only enabled raycasts will be able to query the space and report collisions.
 *
 * RayCast calculates intersection every physics frame (see [Node]), and the result is cached so it can be used later until the next frame. If multiple queries are required between physics frames (or during the same frame), use [method force_raycast_update] after adjusting the raycast.
