 * Imported scenes can be automatically modified right after import by setting their **Custom Script** Import property to a `tool` script that inherits from this class.
 *
 * The [method post_import] callback receives the imported scene's root node and returns the modified version of the scene. Usage example:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * tool # Needed so it runs in editor
 * extends EditorScenePostImport
 * # This sample changes all node names
 * # Called right after the scene is imported and gets the root node
 * func post_import(scene):
 *     # Change all node names to "modified_[oldnodename]"
 *     iterate(scene)
 *     return scene # Remember to return the imported scene
 * func iterate(node):
 *     if node != null:
 *         node.name = "modified_" + node.name
 *         for child in node.get_children():
 *             iterate(child)
