 * This is the node that implements full 3D physics. This means that you do not control a RigidBody directly. Instead, you can apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, collision, bouncing, rotating, etc.

 * A RigidBody has 4 behavior [member mode]s: Rigid, Static, Character, and Kinematic.
 *
 * **Note:** Don't change a RigidBody's position every frame or very often. Sporadic changes work fine, but physics runs at a different granularity (fixed Hz) than usual rendering (process callback) and maybe even in a separate thread, so changing this from a process loop may result in strange behavior. If you need to directly affect the body's state, use [method _integrate_forces], which allows you to directly access the physics state.
 *
 * If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration function. See [member custom_integrator].
