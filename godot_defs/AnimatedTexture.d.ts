 *
 * The playback of the animation is controlled by the [member fps] property as well as each frame's optional delay (see [method set_frame_delay]). The animation loops, i.e. it will restart at frame 0 automatically after playing the last frame.
 *
 * [AnimatedTexture] currently requires all frame textures to have the same size, otherwise the bigger ones will be cropped to match the smallest one.
 *
 * **Note:** AnimatedTexture doesn't support using [AtlasTexture]s. Each frame needs to be a separate [Texture].
