 * Base class of anything 2D. Canvas items are laid out in a tree; children inherit and extend their parent's transform. [CanvasItem] is extended by [Control] for anything GUI-related, and by [Node2D] for anything related to the 2D engine.
 *

 *
 * A [CanvasItem] can also be hidden, which will also hide its children. It provides many ways to change parameters such as modulation (for itself and its children) and self modulation (only for itself), as well as its blend mode.
