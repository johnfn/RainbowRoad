/**
 * A pre-parsed relative or absolute path in a scene tree, for use with [method Node.get_node] and similar functions. It can reference a node, a resource within a node, or a property of a node or resource. For instance, `"Path2D/PathFollow2D/Sprite:texture:size"` would refer to the `size` property of the `texture` resource on the node named `"Sprite"` which is a child of the other named nodes in the path.
 *
 * You will usually just pass a string to [method Node.get_node] and it will be automatically converted, but you may occasionally want to parse a path ahead of time with [NodePath] or the literal syntax `@"path"`. Exporting a [NodePath] variable will give you a node selection widget in the properties panel of the editor, which can often be useful.
 *
 * A [NodePath] is composed of a list of slash-separated node names (like a filesystem path) and an optional colon-separated list of "subnames" which can be resources or properties.
 *
 * Some examples of NodePaths include the following:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * # No leading slash means it is relative to the current node.
 * @"A" # Immediate child A
 * @"A/B" # A's child B
 * @"." # The current node.
 * @".." # The parent node.
 * @"../C" # A sibling node C.
 * # A leading slash means it is absolute from the SceneTree.
 * @"/root" # Equivalent to get_tree().get_root().
 * @"/root/Main" # If your main scene's root node were named "Main".
 * @"/root/MyAutoload" # If you have an autoloaded node or scene.
 * @summary
