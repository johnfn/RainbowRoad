/**
 * Every class which is not a built-in type inherits from this class.
 *
 * You can construct Objects from scripting languages, using `Object.new()` in GDScript, `new Object` in C#, or the "Construct Object" node in VisualScript.
 *
 * Objects do not manage memory. If a class inherits from Object, you will have to delete instances of it manually. To do so, call the [method free] method from your script or delete the instance from C++.
 *
 * Some classes that extend Object add memory management. This is the case of [Reference], which counts references and deletes itself automatically when no longer referenced. [Node], another fundamental type, deletes all its children when freed from memory.
 *
 * Objects export properties, which are mainly useful for storage and editing, but not really so much in programming. Properties are exported in [method _get_property_list] and handled in [method _get] and [method _set]. However, scripting languages and C++ have simpler means to export them.
 *
 * Property membership can be tested directly in GDScript using `in`:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * var n = Node2D.new()
 * print("position" in n) # Prints "True".
 * print("other_property" in n) # Prints "False".
 * @summary 
 * 
 *
 * The `in` operator will evaluate to `true` as long as the key exists, even if the value is `null`.
 *
 * Objects also receive notifications. Notifications are a simple way to notify the object about different events, so they can all be handled together. See [method _notification].
 *
 * **Note:** Unlike references to a [Reference], references to an Object stored in a variable can become invalid without warning. Therefore, it's recommended to use [Reference] for data classes instead of [Object].
