/**
 * Helper to manage undo/redo operations in the editor or custom tools. It works by registering methods and property changes inside "actions".
 *
 * Common behavior is to create an action, then add do/undo calls to functions or property changes, then committing the action.
 *
 * Here's an example on how to add an action to the Godot editor's own [UndoRedo], from a plugin:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * var undo_redo = get_undo_redo() # Method of EditorPlugin.
 * func do_something():
 *     pass # Put your code here.
 * func undo_something():
 *     pass # Put here the code that reverts what's done by "do_something()".
 * func _on_MyButton_pressed():
 *     var node = get_node("MyNode2D")
 *     undo_redo.create_action("Move the node")
 *     undo_redo.add_do_method(self, "do_something")
 *     undo_redo.add_undo_method(self, "undo_something")
 *     undo_redo.add_do_property(node, "position", Vector2(100,100))
 *     undo_redo.add_undo_property(node, "position", node.position)
 *     undo_redo.commit_action()
 * @summary 
 * 
 *
 * [method create_action], [method add_do_method], [method add_undo_method], [method add_do_property], [method add_undo_property], and [method commit_action] should be called one after the other, like in the example. Not doing so could lead to crashes.
 *
 * If you don't need to register a method, you can leave [method add_do_method] and [method add_undo_method] out; the same goes for properties. You can also register more than one method/property.
