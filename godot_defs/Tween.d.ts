/**
 * Tweens are useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be interpolated over a range of values. The name **tween** comes from **in-betweening**, an animation technique where you specify **keyframes** and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them.
 *
 * [Tween] is more suited than [AnimationPlayer] for animations where you don't know the final values in advance. For example, interpolating a dynamically-chosen camera zoom value is best done with a [Tween] node; it would be difficult to do the same thing with an [AnimationPlayer] node.
 *
 * Here is a brief usage example that makes a 2D node move smoothly between two positions:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * var tween = get_node("Tween")
 * tween.interpolate_property($Node2D, "position",
 *         Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(100, 100), 1,
 *         Tween.TRANS_LINEAR, Tween.EASE_IN_OUT)
 * tween.start()
 * @summary 
 * 
 *
 * Many methods require a property name, such as `"position"` above. You can find the correct property name by hovering over the property in the Inspector. You can also provide the components of a property directly by using `"property:component"` (eg. `position:x`), where it would only apply to that particular component.
 *
 * Many of the methods accept `trans_type` and `ease_type`. The first accepts an [enum TransitionType] constant, and refers to the way the timing of the animation is handled (see [url=https://easings.net/]easings.net[/url] for some examples). The second accepts an [enum EaseType] constant, and controls where the `trans_type` is applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you don't know which transition and easing to pick, you can try different [enum TransitionType] constants with [constant EASE_IN_OUT], and use the one that looks best.
