 * Camera node for 2D scenes. It forces the screen (current layer) to scroll following this node. This makes it easier (and faster) to program scrollable scenes than manually changing the position of [CanvasItem]-based nodes.
 *
 * This node is intended to be a simple helper to get things going quickly and it may happen that more functionality is desired to change how the camera works. To make your own custom camera node, inherit from [Node2D] and change the transform of the canvas by setting [member Viewport.canvas_transform] in [Viewport] (you can obtain the current [Viewport] by using [method Node.get_viewport]).
 *
 * Note that the [Camera2D] node's `position` doesn't represent the actual position of the screen, which may differ due to applied smoothing or limits. You can use [method get_camera_screen_center] to get the real position.
