/**
 * [MainLoop] is the abstract base class for a Godot project's game loop. It is inherited by [SceneTree], which is the default game loop implementation used in Godot projects, though it is also possible to write and use one's own [MainLoop] subclass instead of the scene tree.
 *
 * Upon the application start, a [MainLoop] implementation must be provided to the OS; otherwise, the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a [SceneTree] is created) unless a main [Script] is provided from the command line (with e.g. `godot -s my_loop.gd`, which should then be a [MainLoop] implementation.
 *
 * Here is an example script implementing a simple [MainLoop]:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * extends MainLoop
 * var time_elapsed = 0
 * var keys_typed = []
 * var quit = false
 * func _initialize():
 *     print("Initialized:")
 *     print("  Starting time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))
 * func _idle(delta):
 *     time_elapsed += delta
 *     # Return true to end the main loop.
 *     return quit
 * func _input_event(event):
 *     # Record keys.
 *     if event is InputEventKey and event.pressed and !event.echo:
 *         keys_typed.append(OS.get_scancode_string(event.scancode))
 *         # Quit on Escape press.
 *         if event.scancode == KEY_ESCAPE:
 *             quit = true
 *     # Quit on any mouse click.
 *     if event is InputEventMouseButton:
 *         quit = true
 * func _finalize():
 *     print("Finalized:")
 *     print("  End time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))
 *     print("  Keys typed: %s" % var2str(keys_typed))
