 * The VisibilityNotifier detects when it is visible on the screen. It also notifies when its bounding rectangle enters or exits the screen or a [Camera]'s view.

The heuristic is an implementation detail and may change in future versions. If you need precise visibility checking, use another method such as adding an [Area] node as a child of a [Camera] node and/or [method Vector3.dot].
