 * This shows a tree of items that can be selected, expanded and collapsed. The tree can have multiple columns with custom controls like text editing, buttons and popups. It can be useful for structured displays and interactions.

 *     subchild1.set_text(0, "Subchild1")
 * @summary

 *
 * To iterate over all the [TreeItem] objects in a [Tree] object, use [method TreeItem.get_next] and [method TreeItem.get_children] after getting the root through [method get_root]. You can use [method Object.free] on a [TreeItem] to remove it from the [Tree].
